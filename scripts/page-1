Welcome to Try Swift!
=====================

Introduction
------------

This web interface lets you learn Swift from your browser - nothing to install.
You can run the built-in example scripts, change them, and run your own scripts.

* select a code example using the navigation buttons
* view the explanation of the example here
* click [Execute] to run the example
* click [File outputs] to view the output files produced by your script
* click [Reset] to restore the example to its initial state (LOSES YOUR CHANGES!)

.The example scripts are:
. *Hello World* - Shows the basic syntax for running an app to produce a file
. *Foreach* - Introduces the foreach statement to run multiple apps parallel
. *Multiple apps* - Show dependencies between apps to specify a workflow
. *Multi-stage* - Example of a larger multi-stage workflow
